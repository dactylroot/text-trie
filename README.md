## Python Trie

Text Trie (prefix and postfix) class for string storage. Provides a set of strings with optimized storage and lookup.
 
Trie storage optimizes lookup times after adding words to the trie by combining common substrings, then performing a (singlei- or multi-) character-level comparison scan with the member in question.
